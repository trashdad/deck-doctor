"""Project MTGish typed `Rules` trees into structured AbilityRecords.

Canonical `verb` is the raw MTGish `_Action` operator string (lossless); curated
naming is the derive layer's job. The projector handles the structural skeleton
(rule kind, cost, trigger, action lists, control-flow wrappers, amounts, scope,
targeting) and leaves unknown leaf ops as raw verbs (surfaced by the QA
unmapped-operator report).
